Protobuf runtime support library
================================

[![Build Status](https://drone.io/github.com/dart-lang/dart-protobuf/status.png)](https://drone.io/github.com/dart-lang/dart-protobuf/latest)

This library provides runtime support library for Dart implementation
of protobufs.

> If you want to use protocol buffers in your application, you are probably looking for the
> [Protoc compiler](https://github.com/dart-lang/dart-protoc-plugin).
> Typically you **do not need** to import this library â€“ only libraries generated by
> protoc plugin import this library directly.

However, if your library or application uses generated protobuf libraries,
please, add this library as a dependency.

Hacking
-------

So far to hack on the library the main thing you should be aware of is how
to run unittests.  The easiest way would be to use DartEditor and run
`all_tests.dart` file which is the whole suite.

If you'd like to run test from command line, please, do not pass proper
package root.
